## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

### Install and configure Bridge Control Panel (BCP)

The BCP software is used for transmitting and receiving data over I2C. It is installed automatically as part of the [PSoC&trade; Programmer](http://www.cypress.com/psocprogrammer) installation.

1. Go to the [Cypress Programming Solutions](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-programming-solutions) web page.

2. Click the **PSoC&trade; Programmer (Windows)** link to download the installer.

3. Double-click the installer, and then follow the instructions to install PSoC&trade; Programmer.

4. After installation is complete, open BCP from **Start** > **All Programs** > **Cypress** > **Bridge Control Panel** > **Bridge Control Panel**.

5. Select **KitProg3** under **Connected I2C/SPI/RX8 Ports**.
   Note that the PSoC&trade; 4 kit must be connected to the USB port of your computer.

   **Figure 1. Bridge Control Panel**

   ![](images/figure1.png)

6. Select **Tools** \> **Protocol Configuration**. Navigate to the **I2C** tab, and then set the **I2C speed** to **400 kHz**.

7. Click **OK**.

   BCP is now ready for transmitting and receiving data.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[I2C slave using callbacks](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-i2c-slave-callback)" application with the desired name "MyI2CSlaveCallback" configured for the *CY8CKIT-041S-MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-i2c-slave-callback --user-app-name MyI2CSlaveCallback --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

The I2C resource in slave mode accepts command packets to control the intensity of an LED. The I2C slave updates its read buffer with a status packet in response to the accepted command.

In this example, a host PC running the Bridge Control Panel (BCP) software is used as the I2C master. LED control is implemented using a TCPWM resource (configured as PWM). The intensity of the LED is controlled by changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-041S-MAX TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
</details>


3. Configure the BCP software as described in [Software setup](#software-setup).

4. In the **Editor** tab of BCP, type the command to send the LED intensity data, and then click **Send**. Observe that the LED turns ON with the specified intensity.

   The command format that is used to write the data to the slave if BCP is used as the I2C master is shown below. The symbol âSoPâ means âstart of packetâ and âEoPâ means âend of packetâ.
   

   Start for write | Slave address | SoP  | LED TCPWM compare value | EoP  | Stop
   ---------------|---------------|------|-------------------------|------|-----
    w              | 0x08          | 0x01 | 0x00 to 0xFF            | 0x17 | p  

   <br>

   For example, sending the command `w 08 01 FF 17 p` will turn the LED ON with full intensity; sending the command `w 08 01 00 17 p` will turn the LED OFF.

5. Type the command `r 08 x x x p` to read the status of the write performed.

   The following is the command format to read the status form the slaveâs read buffer. The symbol âxâ denotes one byte to read from the slaveâs read buffer. In this example, three bytes are read from the slave.

   Start for read | Slave address | SoP | LED TCPWM compare value | EoP | Stop
    ----------------|---------------|-----|-------------------------|-----|------
    r              | 0x08          | x   | x                       | x   | p   

   <br>

   After each command is sent, the status packet must be read from the read buffer of the slave by sending the `r 08 x x x p` command. If the packet read is in the format `r 08 01 00 17 p`, the status is set as 'success'; if the packet read is `r 08 01 FF 17 p`, the status is set as 'fail' for the command sent by the I2C master. See Figure 1 for more information.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

This example demonstrates the operation of an I2C resource for PSoC&trade; 4 in slave mode using callbacks. The I2C slave is configured with a 3-byte write buffer, which can be accessed by the I2C master to write commands. In addition, a 3-byte read buffer is configured to read the status of the slave by the master. The BCP software is used as the I2C master.

The first byte in the write buffer contains the start of packet (SoP) value, the next byte contains the LEDâs TCPWM compare value, and the third byte is the End of packet (EoP) value. The slave updates the masterâs read buffer with the status packet. The first byte of the status packet is SoP, the second byte contains the status where the value 0x00 means success and 0xFF means failure for the command data sent by the master, and the third byte in the read buffer is EoP.

To control the intensity of the LED, a PWM with a period value of 255 microseconds is used. The duty cycle of the PWM is controlled in firmware and is specified by the I2C master.

In the callback method, data write and read complete events from the master are handled through interrupts. I2C peripheral driver library (PDL) APIs are used to configure the resource to act as an I2C slave, and to configure its relevant interrupts to handle data write and read complete events by the master.
